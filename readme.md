Very basic image bookmarking

### bookmarklet
* ~~get all img elements from page~~
* ~~attach click listener to all elements~~ 
* ~~on click grab image url~~
* ~~sanitize image name better to make sure curl works~~
* ~~and feed it into a curl~~
* ~~filter image js effects to make them accessible on click. better prevent default implementation.~~
* make css background images accessible: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9255312/jquery-select-elements-with-a-certain-css
* add folder = collection name to url
* ~~upload to server~~

### collection view
* ~~display thumbnails of all images on server~~
* (per folder)
* ~~on click open server copy of original image~~
* (add url/title with link to original image file)
* ~~delete files (x btn on hover)~~
* ~~resize images via keypress~~
